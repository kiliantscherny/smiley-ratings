# About the "Smiley" system

<Grid cols=2 gapSize=md>

  <Group>

      <Details title="What is the Smiley system?" open=true>

      The Smiley system is a **food safety inspection system** in Denmark. It is designed to help consumers make informed choices about the food establishments they visit. The system uses a smiley face rating to indicate the level of compliance with food safety regulations (you can see them and what they mean on the right).
      
      </Details>

      <Details title="How does it work?" open=true>

      The smiley is determined by the **worst result.** <Info description="If the establishment scores a 1 in most categories but a 4 in one, the final score would be 4." color="primary" />

      At each inspection a number of areas are checked, and assigned a result (1 - 4). All results and remarks of the inspector are published on the inspection report. The smiley for the inspection is determined by the worst of the results.

      Establishments not complying with regulations will get follow-up inspections, paid by the establishment.

      </Details>

      <Details title="How is it used?" open=true>

      Taken from [The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration website](https://www.findsmiley.dk/English/Pages/FrontPage.aspx):

      > "In October 2023, the new smiley label was implemented. The smiley label, showing the three latest inspection results, must be displayed for consumers to read, before they decide to enter a shop or a restaurant for example. The smiley scheme was implemented in 2001. The three different smileys signal how well a food establishment complies with food regulations."

      > "The Smiley scheme shows how well shops, restaurants and other businesses that sell food to consumers comply with the legal requirements for handling food. The scheme therefore makes it easy for consumers to find companies that have food safety under control. At the same time, the smiley scheme makes it easy for companies to show how well they are complying with the rules."
